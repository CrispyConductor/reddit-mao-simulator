Note: These are just ideas; not all of them may be implemented, and additional inputs not listed here may also be implemented.

Basic String stats:
- Length
- Count of character classes
	- Uppercase
	- Lowercase
	- Punctuation
	- Whitespace
	- Vowel/consonant
	- Each individual character, of letters/numbers/punctuation
- Fractions of character classes (of overall length)
- Max number of any consecutive single letter
- Max of any numeric substring
- Min of any numeric substring
- Max number of any consecutive punctuation
- Max number of any consecutive whitespace

String bayesian inputs:
- Single input for each bayesian processor
- Bayesian processors each operate on words tokenized or processed in different ways
	- Basic bayesian processor; split words on spaces/punctuation/numbers and lowercase
	- Punctuation bayesian processor; works on single punctuation or strings of consecutive punctuation marks
	- Unnormalized bayesian processor; split words on whitespace, no other processing
	- Digram bayesian processor
	- Trigram bayesian processor
	- Di-word bayesian processor

String inputs:
- Basic string stats for whole string
- The maximum of each basic stat for each word in the string
- The minimum of each basic stat for each word in the string
- The mean of each basic stat for each word in the string
